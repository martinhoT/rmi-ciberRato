### General

- We are free to use any standard libraries, including external ones as long as we include them in `build.sh`

### Troubleshooting

-  In case there is a syntax error on `awk`, install `gawk`
-  For maximum score on mapping, use the simulator's `mapping.out` for comparison instead of `robotmaze.out`
